## Demo
This repository includes a SwiftUI demo view (`ZavrDemoView`) that showcases the visual structure and user experience of the Zavr app using mock data.

The demo is intended to demonstrate SwiftUI layout, component design, and UI logic without exposing production business logic or data models.
